# Alternative Deployment Option for BEE SOLAR POWERS

If you're still having trouble with the Vercel deployment showing code instead of the website, here's an alternative approach that separates the frontend and backend:

## Option 1: Static Frontend Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy only the frontend to Vercel

1. In the Vercel project settings, change these settings:
   - Build Command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `client/dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

2. Set these environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: This should point to your backend API URL (see step 2)

3. Deploy and this will create a static site with just your React frontend

### Step 2: Deploy the backend API separately

You have a few options for the backend:

#### Option A: Render.com
1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Set start command: `npm start`
5. Add your environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET)
6. Deploy

#### Option B: Railway.app
1. Create a new project on Railway
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Add a new service with your repo
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy

### Step 3: Connect frontend and backend

1. Once your backend is deployed, get the URL (e.g., `https://bee-solar-api.onrender.com`)
2. Go back to your Vercel project settings
3. Set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to your backend URL
4. Redeploy the frontend

## Option 2: Static Export + Netlify

If Vercel continues to give issues, try Netlify:

1. Create a static export of your React app:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your repository root:
   ```toml
   [build]
     publish = "client/dist"
     command = "cd client && npm install && npm run build"
   
   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

3. Deploy to Netlify by connecting your GitHub repo

This approach completely separates your frontend and backend, which can be easier to debug and deploy.
